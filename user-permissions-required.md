# User permissions required to use auto scale

Auto scale is a technology that allows users to spin up new virtual servers automatically as additional resources are needed and have those server shut down and removed when the extra load subsides.

Access to the auto scale options in the customer portal requires a special user permissions beyond the ability to order and manage {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}}. In order to access the auto scale features a user must have permissions to manage all of the virtual servers on the account in addition to the any future virtual devices added. 

After this permission is added, the user has access to the auto scale options in the **Device** menu.
