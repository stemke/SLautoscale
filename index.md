# Getting started with auto scaling

Auto Scale enables you to automate the manual scaling process associated with adding or removing virtual servers to support your business applications.{:shortdesc}

Key Features:

* Scale out virtual servers seamlessly and automatically on-demand when additional resources are required.
* Scale down virtual servers seamless and automatically on-demand and save money by shedding unnecessary resources
* Flexible triggers for scaling: CPU percentage, outgoing public and private bandwidth, incoming public and private bandwidth
* Real-time status updates for scaling activity in groups
* Optional VLAN and load balancer integration


## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the following prerequisites.

  1. Learn about [auto scaling](as_overview.html).
  2. Ensure you have the proper [user permissions](user-permissions-required.html).
  
## Create an autoscale group 

Review your auto scale options and determine whether resource-based or schedule-based auto scaling is right for you.
<table>
  <tr><th> Auto scale options</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>[Schedule-based autoscaling](traffic_spikes.html)</td>
    <td>Use auto scaling to set up policies for time-based usage spikes, like over weekends or holidays.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>[Resource-based autoscaling](as_manage_resource.html)</td>
    <td>Use auto scaling to set up policies for irregular spikes, based on resource usage.</td>
  </tr>
